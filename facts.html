		<p><li>The hilarious script was penned by Ken Segal, who wrote on other crazy stuff like The Tick and… 
		<p><li>The game contains over 20,000 unique drawings, more than most half-hour cartoons on television! 
		<p><li>All original music composed by Bill Ungerman from the ultra-hip Los Angeles lounge swing band Royal Crown Revue. 
		<p><li>It was made in just around 9 months, from concept to gold master! 
		<p><li>Universal Cartoon Studios optioned the title for development into a series, but after years in development, pulled the plug. 
		<p><li>What company made the game? It was Class6 Entertainment/Interactive. The title was funded by a group of international investors called TechToons. Class6 was an animation production company located in Hollywood (right on the Boulevard!). The studio focused on commercials, interstitials, and a whole ton of CDROM games for other studios. 
		<p><li>It debuted in 1996 at E3 in Los Angeles. Was briefly carried by CompUSA and a few online distributors before it was done-in by too little exposure. 
		<p><li>Were there other games? None that were completed. Class6 was working on a series of 4 different titles when the company folded. All were in various states of completion. 
		<p><li>Was Creature Crunch only an American phenomenon? Why no! It was translated into Dutch (for the Netherlands) and Portuguese (for the Brazil market). The Dutch title was called “Monster Mix” while in Brazil it was called “Criatura Crunch - O Monstro.”
		<p><li>Yeah, but did it win awards?  You bet!
